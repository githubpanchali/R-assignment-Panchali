The scripts begin by installing necessary R packages (readr, dplyr, tidyverse, tidyr, ggplot2) for data manipulation and visualization. Initial steps include loading the genetic datasets (fang_et_al_genotypes.txt and snp_position.txt), followed by detailed inspection and summary statistics to understand the structure and dimension of the data.
Data processing sections are focused on filtering and organizing the data for both maize and teosinte species based on specific group classifications. It involves transposing genotype data, merging it with SNP positions, and creating unique and ordered files for each chromosome with designated symbols for missing data.
For visualization, the scripts generate plots to summarize SNP distributions across chromosomes, compare SNP counts between maize and teosinte, and analyze proportions of homozygous and heterozygous alleles by sample and group. Additionally, it visualizes the distribution of heterozygous alleles in different genotype groups.
