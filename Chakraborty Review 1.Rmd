1. Data Inspection
Comprehensive data structure inspection using dim(), head(), class(), str(), and object.size() was good.
Good practice in checking both dimensions and the content of the data frames to understand the data better.

Consider using summary() for a quick statistical summary that might offer additional insights.

2. Data Processing
Efficient use of dplyr for data manipulation.
Transposition and merging processes are logically structured and well-executed.
The function process_and_save_files is a robust approach for automating the processing and saving of files, demonstrating good coding practices.

3. Visualization
Effective use of ggplot2 for creating informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
Visualization of SNP distribution and heterozygosity provides meaningful insights into the data.
For the SNP distribution plots (p0, p1, p2, p3), consider adding more descriptive labels or a legend to improve interpretability
